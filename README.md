# metasurface-design

This project aims to automate metasurface design utilizing deep learning algorithms. Idea is to train the neural network with
transmission spectrum and unit cell pattern. First random transmission spectrum and patterns are generated through MEEP EM
simulation tools. 

Tasks: 

1) Build desired MEEP simulation script
2) Build neural network 
3) Train and test network
